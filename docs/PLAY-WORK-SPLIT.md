# Play Store work: two tracks

27 September 2026. The tasks from `docs/PLAY-READINESS-REVIEW.md` (the review), split so two people can work at the same time. The review has the evidence and file:line for every item; this file only says who does what, and in what order.

**The split is by files, not by topic.** Track 1 owns the server; Track 2 owns the screens, the policy wording and the Android wrapper. Two people editing the same file on different branches is where merges go wrong, so each file has one owner:

| Files | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| `backend/`, `admin/`, `shared/` | Track 1 |
| `frontend/` (screens, `i18n/strings.ts`, `legal/en.ts`, `legal/mr.ts`), `docs/PLAY-STORE.md`, `docs/DEPLOY.md` | Track 2 |
| The Android wrapper repo (`SMB_Android_App/Android_app`) | Track 2 |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Both. Edit only the section about your own change. |

When your change needs words in a file the other track owns (the policy, a screen label), **send the other person the facts, and they write the words.** Every Marathi string follows `docs/MARATHI-STYLE.md`, whoever writes it.

## Before splitting: together (30 minutes)

- [x] **This repo:** the demo-number send-limit exemption, the privacy policy's developer name and the docs, committed and pushed to `prathamesh2` on 27 September. The policy's "published on Google Play under Team Zenith" sentence went live with it, a little ahead of publication.
- [x] **Wrapper repo:** the package rename and both `google-services.json` files, committed and pushed to `sub-main`. Nothing deploys from that repo.
- [x] Track 1: `play/server` created from `prathamesh2` and pushed on 27 September. Track 2: `play/app` still to create.
- [ ] **Do not push to `prathamesh2` until the joint steps at the end.** Both Vercel projects deploy from it, so a push there is a live release to real sellers and buyers. Pushing a `play/*` branch is fine; Vercel only makes a preview of it.

## Track 1: server, data and admin console

Owner: ____________

| # | Task | Review item | Size |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.1 | **Do this first, day 1:** add `seller` and `customer` to `REPORT_TARGETS` in `shared/src/report.ts`, with their reasons, and push the branch. Track 2's report buttons are built on this. | B3 | 30 min |
| 1.2 | Accept reports on shops and buyers in `POST /reports`. Show them in the admin console (reported shops, reported buyers). | B3 | 2–3 h |
| 1.3 | Block a buyer: an admin route and a console button, keyed on the phone, so she cannot sign in or order again with the same number. Tests. | B3 | 2–3 h |
| 1.4 | Demo safeguards: hide the demo shop from the public catalogue except for the demo number's own buyer session (`catalog.routes.ts:28`), and refuse orders from the demo buyer to real sellers (`orders.routes.ts:141`). Tests. | B1 | 1–2 h |
| 1.5 | A deleted buyer's orders must not come back: in `closeCustomer`, replace `customerId` on her orders, reviews and reports with a random tombstone id. Test that her digits appear nowhere afterwards. | B4 | 1–2 h |
| 1.6 | Finish erasing a closed account:<br>• her products and their photos (remove or tombstone, respecting `isBulkDelete`)<br>• complaints: name, phone, `byUserId`<br>• `order.landmark`, `seller.fssai`, `seller.shopSlug`, `closeNote`<br>• add all of them to `SELLER_PII_FIELDS`<br>**Tell Track 2** whether listings are removed or kept, and that review text stays. | Privacy table | 2–3 h |
| 1.7 | Run `pruneAuthEvents` on the 15-minute housekeeping timer. Write a one-off script that hashes or deletes the raw IPs in old `authEvents` rows with `detail: 'account.close'`. | Privacy table | 1 h |
| 1.8 | Backups: prune the monthly database files (for example, after 12 months) and remove photos from the backup Cloudinary that the live one no longer has. **Tell Track 2** the real retention period. | Privacy table | 2 h |
| 1.9 | Shop details: accept `photo` and `upiQrUrl` only from this Cloudinary account's folders, as `screenshotProblem()` does. | Should fix | 1 h |
| 1.10 | Categories: check `categoryId` against `CATEGORIES` on the server. Rename "सौंदर्य व आरोग्य / Beauty & Wellness" to Beauty & Personal care in `backend/src/db/seed.ts`. | Should fix | 1 h |
| 1.11 | Refuse to start in production when `SEED_DEMO_DATA` is set. | Minor | 15 min |
| 1.12 | Give the roughly 16 backend errors that lack one a `messageMr`. | Minor | 1–2 h |

About 2 working days. Run `npm test` and `npm run typecheck` before handing over.

## Track 2: screens, policy text and Android

Owner: ____________

| # | Task | Review item | Size |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2.1 | **Upload keystore:** create it with the `keytool` command in the wrapper's README, put the four `SMB_UPLOAD_*` values in `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`, and back up the `.jks` and passwords somewhere other than this machine. Whoever will build the .aab should hold it. | Before first upload | 20 min |
| 2.2 | The deletion page names the app: a heading with "Shantai Mahila Bazar" and the college (`screens/landing/DeleteAccount.tsx`). | B5 | 30 min |
| 2.3 | Report buttons, **after Track 1 has pushed 1.1**:<br>• buyers can report reviews on the product page (`reportable` in `Browse.tsx:396`)<br>• "Report this shop" on the shop page and the seller card<br>• sellers can report a buyer from the order screen | B3 | 2–3 h |
| 2.4 | Buyers get a Help / contact card in My Profile, as sellers have. | Should fix | 30 min |
| 2.5 | Fix the misleading strings: `lp.w4b`, `lp.wl3`, `wait.canDoMeanwhile`, `wait.title`, `lp.w1b`. Correct the seller agreement's FSSAI sentence. Leave `lp.wl4` for the ₹50 step. | Should fix | 1 h |
| 2.6 | Policy text, both languages:<br>• hosting logs and their retention<br>• GitHub as a service provider<br>• "review text stays"<br>• what happens to a closed seller's listings (from 1.6)<br>• the backup period (from 1.8), also on the deletion page<br>• no health or cure claims, no supplements or ayurvedic medicines, in the terms | Privacy table, Should fix | 2–3 h |
| 2.7 | Add "and I am 18 or older" to both consent tick-boxes (seller registration and the buyer's name screen). | Privacy table | 30 min |
| 2.8 | **Once 2.6 and 2.7 are finished,** move `POLICY_VERSION` once, because what people agree to has changed (age, health claims). Doing it once means everyone is asked again only once. | — | 10 min |
| 2.9 | `docs/PLAY-STORE.md`:<br>• add User IDs and App interactions (Analytics) to the Data safety table<br>• correct the "Report on every listing and review" claim once 2.3 is done<br>`docs/DEPLOY.md:471-473`: the permission table still lists location permissions the APK no longer has. | Privacy table | 45 min |
| 2.10 | Minor screens:<br>• "Network error" through `t()` on the 10 screens listed in the review<br>• `ConfirmSheet` instead of `confirm()` in `CartCheckout.tsx:1036`<br>• add `/college.jpg` or remove the image<br>• a QR code with no amount in `PaymentQr.tsx:140` | Minor | 2 h |
| 2.11 | Android wrapper (separate repo):<br>• `mixedContentMode="never"`<br>• links to other sites open in the browser<br>• `allowBackup="false"`<br>• `uses-feature` camera and microphone `required="false"`<br>• no `console.log` in release builds<br>• brand-colour spinner<br>This needs a new APK, so it must be finished before the .aab is built. | Should fix | 1–2 h |
| 2.12 | Contact details: ask the college for an official email and desk number to replace the personal ones in `legal/operator.ts`. This is a request to the college, not code, so start it early. | Should fix | Waiting time |

About 2 working days, plus the wait for the college in 2.12. Run `npm test` in `frontend/` before handing over. The Marathi tests check the style sheet's mechanical rules.

## Where the tracks meet

| When | Who | What |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Day 1, first hour | Track 1 → Track 2 | 1.1 pushed, so the report buttons (2.3) can be built |
| After 1.6 | Track 1 → Track 2 | Listings removed or kept, and "review text stays", for the policy (2.6) |
| After 1.8 | Track 1 → Track 2 | The real backup retention period, for the policy and deletion page (2.6) |
| After 2.3 | Track 2 | Correct the reporting claim in PLAY-STORE.md (2.9) |

Everything else is independent.

### Track 1 → Track 2: the facts, as built (27 September, branch `play/server`)

All twelve Track 1 tasks are on `play/server`. What Track 2 needs from them:

**Reports (for 2.3).** `POST /reports` takes `targetType` of `product`, `review`, `seller` or `customer`, with `targetId`, `reason`, `note` (only for `other`) and, for a buyer, an optional `orderId`. The reasons per target are `reasonsFor(target)` in `shared/src/report.ts`; `REPORT_REASONS` still means the product list, so `ReportSheet` should switch to `reasonsFor(targetType)` and `reportProblems(input, targetType)`. New reason codes needing `report.reason.*` strings in `frontend/src/i18n/strings.ts`, both languages: `noDelivery` (shop took money, sent nothing), `abusive`, `noShow` (ordered, never took delivery), `falsePayment` (said they paid, no money came). The admin console's wording for them is in `admin/src/i18n/strings.ts` if you want to match it. A seller reports a buyer with `targetId: order.customerId` and `orderId: order.id`; the server refuses (404) unless an order exists between them. A buyer reports a shop with `targetId: seller.id`. `mayReport(role, target)` says who may report what, so a seller's screen must not offer "report this listing".

**Blocked buyers.** A blocked number gets `403 { error: 'Blocked', messageMr }` from `/auth/otp/verify` after the OTP passes, and the same from `POST /orders`. The OTP screen should show `messageMr` rather than the generic "wrong code" line for a 403.

**Deletion (for 2.6 and the deletion page).**
- A closed seller's **listings are removed**: each is emptied (name, photo, ingredients, material, FSSAI number) the moment the 7-day window ends, and the photo is destroyed; the empty row disappears from the database shortly after.
- **Review text stays**, with the stars, under the `ग्राहक` placeholder name. This was already true and is now in the shared rule.
- A closed buyer's **id is replaced by a random tombstone** on her orders, reviews, reports and complaints, so signing in again with the same number gives a new, empty account. Her complaint to the desk keeps its words and loses her name and phone.
- A **blocked** buyer's phone number is kept after deletion, so the block holds. The policy should say a number blocked for misuse is retained for that purpose.
- **Backups:** deleted data leaves the nightly mirror and the backup photos on the night after deletion, and the dated database files within **12 months**. That is the sentence for the policy and the deletion page.
- The security log (auth events) is now pruned on the clock, so "90 days" is true.

**Demo account.** The demo shop is invisible to everyone but the demo buyer, and orders between demo and real accounts are refused on the server with a Marathi message (`demoOrderProblem` in `backend/src/demo.ts`). Nothing in the app needs to change for it.

**Categories.** `beauty` is now "Beauty & Personal care" / "सौंदर्य व निगा" from the API; `categoryPhoto.ts` keys on the id and is unaffected.

## Together, at the end

- [ ] Merge `play/server` and `play/app` into `prathamesh2`. Run `npm test` and `npm run typecheck` from the root.
- [ ] Deploy the API to Cloud Run **when nobody is ordering**, then push `prathamesh2` so Vercel deploys the frontend and admin console.
- [ ] Re-test the demo login (`9579642050`) on the live site. Change the MSG91 demo OTP to a random 6-digit code if you haven't already.
- [ ] Prepare the demo data: the review's *App access → Production data to prepare* checklist.
- [ ] Fill in Play Console → App access from the review's draft text, and the Data safety form from `docs/PLAY-STORE.md`.
- [ ] **The ₹50 fee:** decide between options A, B and C, then build it. See the review's last section. Under option A this touches both tracks' files, so one person does it, or you split it the same way: server (Track 1) and screens (Track 2).
- [ ] Build the .aab with the upload keystore, upload it to closed testing, and start the 12-tester, 14-day test.

**Uploads to closed testing are reviewed too.** A build that still shows the in-app ₹50 payment could be flagged at that first review. If you want the 14-day clock started before the ₹50 step, accept that risk; otherwise do the ₹50 step before the first upload.
