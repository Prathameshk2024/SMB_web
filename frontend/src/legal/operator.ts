/**
 * WHO RUNS THIS MARKET, AND WHO ANSWERS FOR IT.
 *
 * The Consumer Protection (E-Commerce) Rules 2020 and the IT (Intermediary
 * Guidelines) Rules 2021 both require the operator's legal name and address
 * and a grievance officer's name and contact to be published where a user can
 * find them. Every document quotes these rather than retyping them, so a new
 * officer is one edit here and not five documents that disagree.
 *
 * TWO CONTACTS, ON PURPOSE. The college office is where everyday help goes -
 * the Help cards' call and WhatsApp buttons, and an account deletion by
 * somebody who cannot sign in. The grievance officer is the named person the
 * law asks for, for complaints the office has not settled and for questions
 * about personal data. SUPPORT_PHONE in screens/seller/Misc.tsx is the
 * office's number, and a test keeps the two equal.
