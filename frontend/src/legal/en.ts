 * THE POLICIES, IN ENGLISH.

 * Written for a reader, not a court: short sentences, the thing she needs to
 * know first, and every number taken from the code that enforces it. This is
 * an independent piece of writing from mr.ts - the two say the same things,
 * and a change to one is a reason to re-read the other, never to transliterate.
 *
 * Every claim here about what the app does is a claim about code. When the
 * code changes what is collected, who sees it, what she pays or what she is
 * responsible for, this text changes with it and POLICY_VERSION moves.
