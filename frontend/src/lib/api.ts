 * survives a reload and decides which screens render. They have to agree, and
 * for a long time they did not:
 *
 *  - the server slides the idle window by handing back a fresh token on
 *    `X-Session-Token`. That landed in `wb.token` only. On the next reload
 *    AuthContext wrote the ORIGINAL token back over it, so the window never
 *    actually slid and a seller was signed out exactly seven days after login
 *    however much she had used the app in between;
 *  - a 401 cleared `wb.token` and left `wb.session` sitting there, so the UI
 *    still believed she was signed in while every request failed.
 *
 * So the two events that change a session are published here, and AuthContext
 * is the one place that acts on them. Nothing else clears a session - not a
 * back press, not a reload, not opening /seller again.
