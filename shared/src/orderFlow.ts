/**
 * THE ORDER STATE MACHINE
 * =======================
 * Locked - five states, this order, no additions:
 *
 *   PLACED -> ACCEPTED -> PACKED -> OUT_FOR_DELIVERY -> DELIVERED
 *
 * DELIVERED is the end. There was a COMPLETED after it, and it meant nothing
 * to either side: the seller had already handed the goods over and been paid,
 * the customer already had them, and no screen offered a way to reach it - so
 * every real order sat at DELIVERED with one greyed-out step below it,
 * implying something was still outstanding when nothing was.
 *
 * Payment is deliberately NOT a step in this chain. It sits on its own axis,
 * because a cash order and a UPI order have to walk the same five states.
 * Inserting a payment state into the middle is the change that would break it.
 *
 * There is no delivery OTP. The seller marks DELIVERED herself and that is
 * accepted at face value; the trail in `events` is what admin reviews if a
 * customer disputes it. (The login OTP is a different thing entirely and is
 * still required - see backend/src/services/otp.service.ts.)
 *
 * The backend validates transitions against this table; the frontend draws its
 * buttons from it. Neither hard-codes a status string.
