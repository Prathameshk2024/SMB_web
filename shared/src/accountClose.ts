/**
 * CLOSING AN ACCOUNT
 * ==================
 * Google Play requires that an app which lets people make an account lets them
 * delete it, from inside the app and from a web page anyone can open. This
 * file is the rule both sides read; `backend/src/db/accountClose.ts` applies it.
 *
 * WHAT "DELETED" MEANS HERE. The row stays and the person is erased. Three
 * reasons, in order of weight:
 *
 * 1. A past order is the BUYER's record as much as the seller's, and the ₹50
 *    payments are the programme's accounts. Both outlive her account, and
 *    Play allows keeping what accounting and the other party need as long as
 *    the privacy policy says so.
 * 2. Removing rows can be REFUSED. A single persist may not delete more than
 *    half a collection (`isBulkDelete`), and a seller with five listings in a
 *    small catalogue is more than half of it. A delete that sometimes does not
 *    delete is worse than none.
 * 3. Orders and the admin console look a seller up by id. An id pointing at
 *    nothing is a blank shop name on somebody else's order screen.
 *
 * So `scrubSeller` empties every field that is *her* - phone, name, photo,
 * address, UPI, the readiness answers, an admin's notes about her - and leaves
 * an id, a status of CLOSED and the money trail. Her phone number goes back
 * into circulation: registration checks it against stored phones, and hers is
 * now blank, so she can start again from scratch if she ever wants to.
 *
 * THE SEVEN DAYS. Her shop closes the moment she asks - hidden from the
 * catalogue, signed out everywhere - but the erasing happens a week later, and
 * signing in during that week offers to stop it. Two confirmation screens and
 * four typed digits stop a stray tap; nothing but time helps a woman who
 * tapped through all of them without understanding what her shop was worth to
 * her. A customer gets no window: an address list is not a livelihood.

 * else's number, and closing a rival's shop must not be one message away.

 * happened, and - for a seller, whose page the admin already has open - the
 * last four digits of her number typed, the same stray-click guard her own
