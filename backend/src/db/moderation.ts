 * is what made the Firebase console unreadable. Swept on read, like an expired
 * rejection, because there is no other moment that reliably arrives.
 *
 * In place, for the same reason `purgeRejected` is: `db.products` is
 * the live array every route holds a reference to.
 *
 * A closed seller's listings become ARCHIVED tombstones too (`scrubProducts`),
 * and that is why this sweep now stops short of a bulk delete: five empty
 * rows in a catalogue of eight would be refused by the persist and leave
 * memory and Firestore disagreeing. They wait, holding nothing, until the
 * catalogue is big enough for their removal to be an ordinary write.
